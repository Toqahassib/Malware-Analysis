However, if a keylogging software is downloaded on your device, it will be diligently logging every keystroke you make. Keyloggers are software tools that track your offline and online activity and provide hackers with access to your personal information. By keeping track of your keystrokes, websites you browse, passwords you type, and credit card details can all be tracked.
